    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a Southern California version of sweet and sour chicken, 
        marinated and grilled with a little extra spice. Great for all barbeque lovers. 
        I usually serve cut into lengths with fresh cilantro, homemade salsa, guacamole, 
        black beans, and flour tortillas warmed on the grill.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 oranges, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>2 lemons, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>2 limes, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup wildflower honey</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 
            about 3/4-inch thickness</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir the orange zest, orange juice, lemon zest, lemon juice, 
            lime zest, lime juice, coriander, red pepper flakes, olive oil, 
            and honey together in a shallow dish. Remove about 1/4 cup of the mixture 
            and set aside for later. Add the chicken breasts to the remaining marinade,
             turning to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, turning
              occasionally, 1 to 4 hours.
        </li>

        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove 
            the chicken breasts from the marinade; discard the marinade.
        </li>

        <li>
            Basting frequently with the reserved sauce, cook the chicken on the 
            preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run 
            clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
             the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
